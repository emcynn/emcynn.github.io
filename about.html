                <p>It Takes Two is a 2021 cooperative action-adventure platform video game developed by Hazelight Studios and published by Electronic Arts. This game delves into the interpersonal dynamics between two individuals. During May and Cody's journey, we witness their initial frustration and resentment evolve into love and mutual understanding. While many games have explored themes like depression and grief, It Takes Two stands out as perhaps the first game to address the challenge of mending a fractured relationship.</p>
